# Data
I am passionate about evidence-based decision making and have lived at the nexus between data science and policy throughout my career. I love diving into the data in search of insights and then applying those insights in the real world. When I'm not wrangling data, I am wrangling my two sons into skis, onto bikes, and generally out into nature.
